			I hereby accept full responsibility for the payment of school fees and

			We empathize deeply with parents facing financial challenges. Regrettably,
			our centre does not receive any financial assistance which means our
			existence relies entirely on tuition fees. In the event of a student’s
			access being denied due to non-payment, re-entry will be permitted once
			tuition fees are current, alongside a new registration fee of R1 500.
			Thank you for understanding.
