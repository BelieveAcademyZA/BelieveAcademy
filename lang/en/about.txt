Welcome to Believe Academy, formerly known as Hartenbos Academy, where our journey began two and a half years ago. From humble beginnings with just six students and two dedicated teachers, we've grown into a vibrant community of more than 20 students.
With a team of nine highly skilled and caring tutors, we are dedicated to providing a nurturing environment rooted in the esteemed Cambridge Curriculum, GED and Impaq. At Believe Academy, we prioritize a holistic approach to education, fostering a sense of belonging and family among our students.
Here, we cherish both the moments of laughter and the times of shared challenges, as we work tirelessly to bring out the best in every student. Join us on our journey of learning, growth, and unwavering belief in the transformative power of education.
