<h4>Secondary School</h4>
<p>
	Cambridge System (Level 10-13) – Cambridge IGCSE, AS and A-Level
	(presented in English)
</p>

<p>
	A minimum grade of 60% in each Level/Grade 9 subject is
	necessary for students wishing to pursue the demanding
	IGCSE, AS, and A-level Cambridge route. A consistent
	record of high marks and a matric exemption grants
	admission to most national and international
	universities.
</p>

<p>
	This system is subdivided into two parts:
</p>

<p>
	Part 1: IGCSE (International General Certificate in Secondary Education)
</p>

<p>
	This 2-year programme corresponds academically with
	South Africa’s grades 10 and 11. Support is presented
	for English First Language, Afrikaans Second Language,
	Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Business
	Studies and Religious Studies. IGCSE is a demanding
	study that requires 60% per subject to pass. Some
	universities and colleges accept the IGCSE certificate
	as sufficient for further studies.
</p>

<p>
	Part 2: AS &amp; A-Levels (Advanced Subsidiary &amp; Advanced levels)
</p>

<p>
	Each level is described as a 1-year course and the
	A-level (equivalent to Grade 13) follows the AS-level
	(equivalent to Grade 12). However, students may
	directly enroll for the A-level after passing the
	IGCSE (60%). The Believe Academy assists in all
	subjects listed in the IGCSE section.
</p>

<p>
	Subject combinations and matric exemption are discussed separately.
