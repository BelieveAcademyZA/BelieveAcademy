<h2>About us</h2>

<p>
	Welcome to Believe Academy, formerly
	known as Hartenbos Academy, where our
	journey began two and a half years ago.
	From humble beginnings in July 2021,
	with just six students and two dedicated
	teachers, weâ€™ve grown into a vibrant
	community of more than 20 students.
</p>

<p>
	With a team of nine highly skilled and
	caring tutors, we are dedicated to
	providing a nurturing environment
	rooted in the esteemed Cambridge, CAPS
	(Impaq) and GED curricula. At Believe
	Academy, we prioritize a holistic
	approach to education, fostering a
	sense of belonging and family among
	our students.
</p>

<p>
	Here, we cherish both the moments of
	laughter and the times of shared
	challenges, as we work tirelessly to
	bring out the best in every student.
	Join us on our journey of learning,
	growth, and unwavering belief in the
	transformative power of education.
