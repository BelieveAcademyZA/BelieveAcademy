<h2>Subject Choices (Cambridge System)</h2>

<p>
	English as a First Language, Afrikaans as a
	Second Language, Mathematics and any Science
	subject (at this level, Science is subdivided
	into three separate subjects, Biology,
	Chemistry and Physics) are compulsory.
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
	Besides the abovementioned subjects, Believe
	Academy assists with Business and Religious Studies.
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
	Subjects are divided into four groups; one
	subject from each group is compulsory. With
	the choices we suggest, this rule is enforced.
	You will comply with the regulations by
	studying the mandatory English, Afrikaans,
	Mathematics and Science (anyone). Two subjects
	from the other Sciences (not the compulsory one),
	Business Studies and Religious Studies, will
	complete your IGCSE subjects. Five of these
	subjects must be passed with at least 60%
	to obtain the IGCSE.
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
	Examinations are written twice yearly (winter
	and summer); you may write whenever you are
	ready. However, the two-sitting rule applies.
	This rule requires you to complete all your
	subjects within two years (from writing the
	first paper to the last one, which must be
	completed within two years).
</p>

<p>
	Students may directly enroll in A-level
	courses after completing their IGCSE. The
	first year will be the equivalent of
	AS-level and the second year will complete
	the A-level. A-level courses are advised
	for students who intend to study Medicine,
	Veterinary Science, etc.
