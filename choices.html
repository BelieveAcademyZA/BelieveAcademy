		<h2>Academic Choices</h2>

		<p>
			Unlock your academic potential with Cambridge Primary, Lower
			Secondary, IGCSE, AS and A levels, or Pre-GED and GED programs.
		</p>

		<h4>Cambridge Primary (Level 4-6)</h4>
		<p>
			These levels lay a strong foundation in English, Afrikaans,
			Mathematics and Science with the comprehensive Cambridge curriculum
			designed to foster critical thinking and creativity.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Cambridge Lower Secondary (Level 7-9)</h4>
		<p>
			The Lower Secondary Level is particularly beneficial in preparing
			the student for the next phase of academic pursuits. Subjects like
			English, Afrikaans, Mathematics and Science prepare the students
			to face the challenges of higher education.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			At this stage of academic development, students face significant
			decisions that can shape their educational and career paths.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Their academic progress at Level 9 will be central to their
			subject choices for further studies.
		</p>
		
		<h4 class="underline">ACADEMIC OPTION 1: Cambridge IGCSE, AS and A-Level</h4>
		<p>
			A minimum grade of 60% in each subject is necessary for students
			wishing to pursue the demanding IGCSE, AS, and A-level Cambridge
			route. A consistent record of high marks and a matric exemption
			grants admission to most national and international universities.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Students who want to pursue the challenging IGCSE, AS, and
			A-level Cambridge route must have a minimum mark of 60% in
			each subject. Most national and foreign colleges admit
			students with a matric exemption and a persistent record of
			high grades.
		</p>
		
		<h4 class="underline">ACADEMIC OPTION 2: Alternative Career paths</h4>
		<p>
			An interest in obtaining a matric certificate, vocational
			training, or a limited number of academic careers are alternatives.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="underline bold">Matriculation Certificate:</span>
			It typically represents the successful completion of secondary
			education and may open doors to university or college programmes.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="bold underline">Vocational Training:</span>
			Vocational training is a practical and hands-on approach
			to learning specific skills for a particular trade or profession.
		</p>
		<p>
			For this choice, a pre-GED and a 
			*<span title="GED (General Educational Development)">GED</span>
			are accepted at UNISA, Varsity College and University of the
			People and the University of Johannesburg.
		</p>
		<p style="color: #555;">
			*GED (General Educational Development)
		</p>

		<h4>GED (General Educational Development)</h4>
		<p>
			Get ready for success in the GED examination with our tailored
			program. That will ensure you have the knowledge and skills to
			ace the test and pursue your academic goals. Subjects are
			English, Mathematics, Science and Social Studies. Psychology
			and Therapy lectures are added for Neuro-Diversity students.
		</p>

		<h4>IGCSE (International General Certificate in Secondary Education)</h4>
		<p>
			This 2-year programme corresponds academically with South
			Africaâ€™s grades 10 and 11. Support is presented for English
			First Language, Afrikaans Second Language, Mathematics, Biology,
			Chemistry, Physics, Business Studies and Religious Studies.
			IGCSE is a demanding study that requires 60% per subject to pass.
			Some universities and colleges accept the IGCSE certificate as
			sufficient for further studies.
		</p>

		<h4>AS & A-Levels (Advanced Subsidiary & Advanced levels)</h4>
		<p>
			Each level is described as a 1-year course and the A-level
			(equivalent to Grade 13) follows the AS-level (equivalent to
			Grade 12). However, students may directly enroll for the A-level
			after passing the IGCSE (60%). Believe Academy assists in all
			subjects listed in the IGCSE section.
		</p>

		<p>
			The choice of subjects and examination requirements will be discussed separately.
