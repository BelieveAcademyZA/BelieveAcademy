		<h4 class="underline">CAMBRIDGE LOWER SECONDARY</h4>
    <p>
      The Lower Secondary Level is particularly beneficial in preparing
      the student for the next phase of academic pursuits. Subjects like
      English, Afrikaans, Mathematics and Science prepare the students
      to face the challenges of higher education.
    </p>

    <p>
      At this stage of academic development, students face significant
      decisions that can shape their educational and career paths.
    </p>

    <p>
      Their academic progress at Level 9 will be central to their
      subject choices for further studies.
    </p>

    <h4 class="underline">ACADEMIC OPTION 1: Cambridge IGCSE, AS and A-Level</h4>
    <p>
      A minimum grade of 60% in each subject is necessary for students
      wishing to pursue the demanding IGCSE, AS, and A-level Cambridge
      route. A consistent record of high marks and a matric exemption
      grants admission to most national and international universities.
    </p>

    <p>
      Students who want to pursue the challenging IGCSE, AS, and
      A-level Cambridge route must have a minimum mark of 60% in
      each subject. Most national and foreign colleges admit
      students with a matric exemption and a persistent record of
      high grades.
    </p>
    
    <h4 class="underline">ACADEMIC OPTION 2: Alternative Career paths</h4>
    <p>
      An interest in obtaining a matric certificate, vocational
      training, or a limited number of academic careers are alternatives.
    </p>
