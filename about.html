      Welcome to Believe Academy, formerly known as Hartenbos Academy, where our journey
      began two and a half years ago. From humble beginnings with just six students and
      two dedicated teachers, we've grown into a vibrant community of 24 students.
    </p>

    <p>
      With a team of nine highly skilled and caring tutors, we are dedicated to providing
      a nurturing environment rooted in the esteemed Cambridge Curriculum and GED. At
      Believe Academy, we prioritize a holistic approach to education, fostering a sense
      of belonging and family among our students.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here, we cherish both the moments of laughter and the times of shared challenges,
      as we work tirelessly to bring out the best in every student. Join us on our journey
      of learning, growth, and unwavering belief in the transformative power of education.
