    <h2>Subject Choices</h2>

    <p>
      English as a First Language, Afrikaans as a Second Language, Mathematics
      and any Science subject (at this level, Science is subdivided into three
      separate subjects, Biology, Chemistry and Physics) is compulsory.
    </p>

    <p>
      Besides the subjects mentioned above, Believe Academy also assists with
      Business and Religious Studies.
    </p>

    <p>
      Subjects are divided into four groups; one subject from each group is
      compulsory.  With the choices we suggest, this rule is enforced.  You
      will comply with the regulations by studying the mandatory English,
      Afrikaans, Mathematics and Science (anyone).  Two subjects from the other
      Sciences (not the compulsory one), Business Studies and Religious Studies,
      will complete your IGCSE subjects.  Five of these subjects must be passed
      with at least 60% to obtain the IGCSE.
    </p>

    <p>
      Examinations are written twice a year (winter and summer); you may write
      whenever you are ready.  However, the two-sitting rule applies.  This
      rule requires you to complete all your subjects within two years (from
      writing the first paper to the last one, which must be completed within
      two years).
    </p>

    <p>
      Students may directly enroll in A-level courses after completing their
      IGCSE.  The first year will be the equivalent of AS-level and the second
      year will complete the A-level.  A-level courses are advised for students
      who intend to study Medicine, Veterinary Science, etc.
